# About Vauban

Vauban was founded by Rémy Astie and Ulric Musset with a passion to revolutionise the way we invest in private companies - by making it as simple and pain-free as how you would invest on Robinhood in public stocks.

We have been backed by key venture partners such as PenTech, Outward, Kima Ventures, West Loop Ventures, United First Partners, and Pi Labs. Vauban is headquartered in London and is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN 825317).


We value diversity at Vauban, we know that innovation thrives on teams where diverse points of view come together to solve hard problems in ways that are just now possible. As such, we explicitly seek people that bring diverse life experiences, diverse educational backgrounds, diverse cultures, and diverse work experiences, and would particularly encourage applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. We’d love to hear from you even if you don’t match all the above criteria or are seeking other opportunities that we’re not currently advertising.

Please be prepared to share with us how your perspective will bring something unique and valuable to our team.
