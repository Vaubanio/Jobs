# Vauban Jobs

This repository is a source for open roles at Vauban. We have mirrored these roles and their descriptions to seceral other platforms. All open roles are in the base level of this directory. 

There's a ./inactive directory that contains roles that are no longer active or we have already hired people into. This folder is being kept here to give potential context on the roles we've hired for in the past and how we describe them.

If you have any questions about Vauban, our open roles or how we work as a team please contact careers@vauban.io, we'd love to talk to you.
